# Version 4


- Database - (Laura likes to start with the database so she can use Postman to ensure it's working.)
X1. Create the table schema for the tables that I will need in my databse. 
    2. I can reference my airtable project for the table structure + data types. 
(CREATE TABLE commands, listing the columns + data types)
- Deploy a database server on render
2. Connect to our render using PGadmin
3. Run the commands to create our data tables. 


- Web Server/API
X. Create a webserver folder inside the root countries-API folder, called 'server'
X. Inside the 'server' folder, create the web server instance:
    1. Adding NPM = package. json, installing express, installing pg, adding .gitignore, adding the src folder (see full list in ________)
    // Steps for creating a Node/Express server
            X 1. In your project folder, run npm init
            X 2. Install express by running npm install express
            X 3. Add a .gitignore to our project for the node_modules
            X 4. Create a src folder to hold our custom JS code, create a index.js file to store all of our web server code.
            X 5. Add all of your import statements (3rd party modules, Node modules, your custom modules)
            X 6. Add the "boilerplate" code for Express, creating the instance, adding the port, adding the listener
            X 7. Add API endpoints + helper functions

X. Add the config file to connect to our database (same one used in our programming_languages in our ________)
X Build our express app (in our index.js file), starting with our imports and the Express boilerplate code. 
X Reference our API endpoint document (that we created that listed out the different API endpdoints) create the endpoints and helper functions for each user action. POST - user submit form, POST - user adds a saved country, GET- get user data, POST - updates country count for each country. Be sure to have an API request for each of these user actions. 
X Test your endpoints using Postman (Optional) Ex: If I'm submitting the users info, you can send it in postman as a JSON object, and when you're running your server locally, ensure the user data has been added as a new row of data in the database. (You can check this by clicking "View All Data in PGAdmin).

- Run node index.js in src folder 
- Open Postman 
- 

- Frontend 
1. Refactor the code (either local storage or Firebase) so that the user actions are tied to calling an API fetch request to the "localhost:3000/end-point". Ex: in the form component, you have an onsubmit where the user adds their user profile infor - you'd want to use a fetch - localhost:3000/add-user-profile to send user profile data. * Do this everywhere the user interacts with website: All POSTS and GET requests. 
2. If you get to this step and you're seeing a "CORS" issue in the console, reach out to Laura, she will help trouble shoot
